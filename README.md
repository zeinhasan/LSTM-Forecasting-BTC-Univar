Implementing Long Short Term Memory Algorithm to Forecast Bitcoin Univariat

# Background
The technological advancements happening today are influencing every aspect of life, including investments. Many new investment instruments have emerged, each with its own characteristics and potential. One of the popular investment instruments recently is cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency secured by cryptography, making it nearly impossible to counterfeit or double-spend. Cryptography itself is a method used to protect information and communication channels through the use of codes.

During the COVID-19 pandemic over the past two years, many investors have been concerned about instruments or assets impacted by the global economic downturn caused by the pandemic. As a result, many people have moved their money into cryptocurrencies. As of now, there are thousands of alternative cryptocurrencies with various functions and specifications. The current value of cryptocurrencies is around $214 billion. As the first blockchain-based cryptocurrency, Bitcoin currently represents more than 68% of this total value.

# Result
The price movement of Bitcoin over the last five years, starting in 2017, showed that the price of Bitcoin was at its lowest compared to the following years, around $1726. Then, it experienced a price decline from 2018 to 2019. There was a significant price fluctuation between the period before the end of 2021 and the period after 2021, with an increase of about 134%.

Next, based on the plot of actual data and predicted data (train predict data and test predict data), the effectiveness of the model can be evaluated. The plot above shows that the predicted price pattern almost follows the same pattern as the actual price. The biggest difference occurred from April to September 2021. The largest discrepancy between the predicted and actual prices happened in May 2021, where the actual price was around $0.7, while the predicted price was around $0.4.

The accuracy of the forecasting results was measured using MAE (Mean Absolute Error), and the MAE value obtained was 0.09207001328468323, resulting in an MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) of 9.207%. From this MAPE value, it can be seen that the prediction results using 50 neurons in the hidden layer and 100 epochs have an accuracy of 90.793%.

Predicting Bitcoin prices is not an easy task, as shown by the graph in Figure 2, which depicts irregular and drastic price movements, indicating that Bitcoin has never been stable for a long period.

The forecasting results obtained based on the model from the training process show a decline in Bitcoin prices. This is evident from the yellow line, which represents the forecast results, trending downwards.
